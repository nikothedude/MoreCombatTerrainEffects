1.8.0
Campaign objectives (Nav buoys, comm relays, sensor relays) now have in-combat effects
    Increase coordinated maneuvers
    Increase CP regen
    Increase weapon range

    Intensity changes based on campaign distance from these objectives

Indevo integration - minefields now spawn mines in-combat
    Lower performance than star fortress mines
    Can target both sides at once if neutral
        Due to engine limitations, mines targetting enemies will always be allied, so you cant shoot them down

Polished some numbers into ints and gave nebula a new icon
Fixed missions endlessly loading settings

1.7.2
Update to station augments 1.0.0

1.7.1
Tweaked some station augment stuff

1.7.0
Station augments support - rare augments that create terrain effects can now be found if both mods are enabled (NOTE ITS CURRENTLY INDEV)
Fixed a bug where the game would fail to spawn the talon that is blamed for hyperstorm lightning
Fixed a bug where missions were crashing

1.6.0
New lunasettings option for controlling how strong UNGP effects are

1.5.2

Fixed DEM lasers having reduced range in magfields and acting weirdly as a result

1.5.1

Meson fields now actually have extra effects in meson storms
Removed the "release" preset, as I realzied it honestly kinda sucks and really makes magfields lame

1.5.0
Clarified that the error message toggle is in lunasettings

Now has UNGP rules for applying terrain effects to all battles
    The backend has been notably refactored to allow for this
    Uses enums now, and a significantly different approach to instantiating effects

    YOU CANNOT DISABLE MCTE IF YOU HAVE THESE RULES ENABLED! IT WILL PROBABLY CRASH

By default, the slipstream PPT mult is now very forgiving
    Its more fun this way

1.4.3
Fixed a yuri expedition crash with magfields

1.4.2
Fixed a long-standing (apparantly) bug where ECCM didnt work in magfields (ugh)

1.4.1
Hotfix for a settings crash (WHY DID THIS NEVER CRASH FOR ME WTF)

1.4.0
New effect: Meson Field (More Planetary Conditions)
    The field moderately increases non-missile weapon range and vision range
    The storm significantly increases all weapon range, vision range, system range, and wing engagement range

Fixed terrain effects applying when fighting on a hypershunt (or a gravitational dynamo for you RAT fans)

New lunasettings config
    Block effects on terrain-blocker interaction
    Block effects on terrain-blocker proximity

Fixed lunasettings not updating after being changed

Fully uncoupled terrain effects from the terrain plugins
    Theoretically, a mission can now be ran with terrain effects

Nex integration
    Hyperstorms
        Chance to strike a few industries with lightning
        Does massive damage to all units and can disorganize
        Holders of the industry receive less damage
        Blocked by planetary shield
    Pulsar
        All units disorganized until the pulsar goes away
        Does chip damage to all units slowly
        Blocked by planetary shield

LunaSettings separated into sections

1.3.2:

Hotfix for nexerelin crash

1.3.1:
Finally using the correct version num in changelog

Now using reflection to call obfuscated functions which allows this to work on Mac and Linux

1.2.5:

Update to starsector 0.97

Disabled nebula effects by default
    Too annoying
    Restore settings to default in lunasettings to see this change

Added a new MCTE_settings.json preset: "Release"
    More forgiving
    Magnetic fields nerfed in it
    Default

    Old "standard" preset no longer the "standard"

1.2.4:

Migrated most lunalib settings to json
    Allows me to change settings between versions
        If you had any custom settings, migrate them, please
    Some settings may have been erronously changed in this migration
    You can now use MCTE_reloadSettings config in-combat and some things may change to config

New settings
    Hyperstorm
        MCTE_hyperstormTimesToArc: 5
            The amount of arcs the final damaging arc will be split into
                Higher = more spread out damage
                High EMP damage values spread out across many points = devastating
    Slipstream
        Add SO range debuffs
            If range threshold isnt modified, SO range is mimicked
            Not guaranteed to always work, especially if you have psuedo-SO like forced overdrive from tahlan!

Pulsar
    EMP damage of projectiles -> 70 base
        You REALLY feel the damage, now
Hyperstorm
    Range of arcs -> 1200 from 1000
    Min/Max strike timers -> 2/5 from 5/7
    Grace period -> 3 from 5
    Arc emp damage -> 12000
        For such a rare effect, you'd better bet the effects are gonna be pretty significant

1.2.3:

New settings:

Solar Shielding Effect Mult: Control the multipler applied to solar shielding for effects that use them
    E.g. Black holes

Updated tips.json to reflect the fact we use lunalib

Default lunalib settings changed
    Nebula no longer removes zero flux boost

1.2.2:
Fixes a long-standing bug with pulsars making weapons do infinite EMP damage (finally)
Adjusts hyperstorm targetting math again

Adjusts default lunalib settings, please reset your configs to default

1.2.1:
Update to newest version, again

Hyperstorm nebula creation now works better and can even arc across clouds
Hyperstorm targetting now lowers your speed-to-not-get-hit threshold if your mass is above the given threshold

New lunalib settings:
Untargetability mass threshold
Targetting coefficient: Mass
Maximum multiplier: Mass
Targetting coefficient: Speed
Maximum multiplier: Speed

1.2.0:
Update to Starsector 0.96a
Updated LunaLib config, sliders now work woo

Hyperstorm targetting is now far more random and less predictable
Hyperstorm targetting now favors fighters and missiles far less
Hyperstorm targetting now favors mass more
Hyperstorm radius doubled (Will cause a few visual errors)

Default settings to lunalib changed

New lunalib settings:
Randomness threshold for hyperstorms - Decide how "random" the targetting is
Toggle for sidebar info - No more spam in the side of your screen

Fixed a bug where slipstreams would infinitely stack speed onto SO-d ships
Fixed a bug where slipstreams would consider tangible objects intangible and vice versa

Hyperstorms are now much less likely to strike low-mass targets

1.1.4:
Once again, changed how the OS detection works to maybe fix the fucking classnotfound crash

1.1.3:
Internal:
Replaces most timers with intervalutils

Features:
All effects now constantly re-apply their stat changes, to allow for dynamic changes, such as the slipstream change
Slipstreams no longer affect intangible ships
If solar shielding/ECCM/whatever changes during combat, terrain effects will now change their values to account for it

Config:
New config option: Determine if slipstreams affect intangible entities or not

Bugfixes:
Fixed a bug where pulsars kept their EMP damage increase applied even after the battle ends, and applied it to all weapons
Please watch pulsar battles for excessive EMP damage as I realized a flaw in my implementation that may still be broke

1.1.2:
Adds lunalib headers
Fixes hyperspace crashes for non-windows
Some nebula adjustments

1.1.1a:
Removes magiclib dependency

1.1.1:
SAVE COMPATABLE
Removes redundant feature that doesnt work
Adjusts some values in settings, notably hyperstorm lightning delay
Makes things like hardflux gen and gravity respect time dilation better

1.1.0:
MAYBE SAVE COMPATIBLE I DUNNO
Migrated settings to data/config/LunaSettings.csv (Press F2 to configure your settings in-game)
Added lunasettings dependency
Made the code safer and less likely to break the game
Made pulsars and black holes more intense
Deep hyperspace now spawns a ton of clouds
More changes that I do not remember! Woo!

1.0.1b:
SAVE COMPATABLE
Brute forces a fix to the NaN crashes. Give me your log if you see an error.

1.0.1a:
SAVE COMPATABLE
Fixes a rare crash with nebulae's cellsize being 0, causing division by zero

1.0.1:
SAVE COMPATABLE
Fixed a pulsar bug
Nebulae now slow you down less if you have insulated engine assembly
Misc polish
New config settings, adjusted config settings

1.0.0: RELEASE
SAVE COMPATABLE
Hyperstorm lightning now launches it's target super fast
Hyperstorms now respect mass and speed of any ship that it wants to strike
Some adjustments to hyperstorms to make the AI less likely to vent while in danger of lightning
Adjusted lightning values to do far less energy damage, as it's really annoying to watch my carriers keep blowing up to lightning because they don't know how to react
Hyperstorms now properly function when their target is no longer available to be struck
Adjusted some magfield values to make it more functional

Slipstreams now double your 0 flux boost if you already have the 0 flux boost permanently active
A few adjustments to slipstreams

The next 2 effects replace or mitigate the vanilla CR penalties, this is configurable in the config
NEW EFFECT: BLACK HOLE
Drags all entities in combat towards itself with a rather powerful pull, missiles and projectiles will drift, and slow ships will struggle. Not affected by solar shielding
Increases timeflow on all ships. This effect is reduced by solar shielding, making solar shielding affect your combat performance negatively

NEW EFFECT: PULSAR
Pushes all entities in combat away from itself with a modest push, the only things that will struggle are things like MIRV warheads. Affected by solar shielding
Decreases shield efficiency and EMP arc penetration resist, increases shield upkeep
Randomly EMPs ships that don't have a 360 degree shield
Slowly increases hardflux on all ships that arent fighters
Charges all projectiles with a flat bonus to EMP damage (vulkan spam is now VERY viable), NOT affected by solar shielding
